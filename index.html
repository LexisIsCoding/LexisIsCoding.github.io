<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>After completing an HND in software development at City of Glasgow College, I am now studying for a BSc Hons in software engineering at University of Strathclyde.</p>
<p>My skills include Java, C#, ASP.NET, and SQL. Though I am currently trying to expand my skill-range with things like JavaScript and C.<br />I'm also good with UML diagrams and designing databases.</p>
<h2>On my GitHub:</h2>
<p>On my GitHub account - <br />LexisIsCoding:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/LexisIsCoding">https://github.com/LexisIsCoding</a><br />You can find repositories for a few of the projects I have worked on.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TheatreBlogAssessment&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This was a practice assessment I did in college for a class. It's a basic blog posting website made with C#, HTML, JavaScript, and MVC.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges during this project was keeping my workflow straight in my head as this was one of the first self-led class projects I had taken on.&nbsp;<br />Using GitHub wasn't required for the class but I decided to use it after facing lots of problems at the beginning of the project. I had to start over a few times as after completing one feature, working on the next I would break the previous one and not be sure how to undo my mistake. I also lost track of which features were complete and where the code was for certain features a lot.<br />GitHub was a perfect fix for these issues as it let me reverse changes that broke the system through version control and track what I had done and why through commit messages.</p>
